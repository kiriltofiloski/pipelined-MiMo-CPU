@testing 2by2 correlating predictor
@The LHT correlating predictor does not work well in all situations
@Sometimes, unrelated jumps(that do not share the same address space in the LHT) may affect the correlating predictor and make predictions worse.
@ Another version of a correlating predictor is one that does not relly on the address space.
@ It is composed of 4 2-bit predictors and a 'Master' register that dinamically chooses which of the 2-bit predictors to use based on previous predictions
@ we'll take the same code as with our LHT correlating predictor, but expand it with an extra unrelated jump (with diffrent last 3 address bits)
